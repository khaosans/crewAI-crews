## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Install Dependencies**

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages using `pip`:

pip install flask gunicorn python-dotenv
2. Environment Configuration
Create a .env file in the project root (if you are using python-dotenv) and add the following environment variables:

makefile
Copy code
FLASK_ENV=production
3. Run the Application
Development Mode
To run the application in development mode:

sh
Copy code
python app.py
Production Mode
For a production environment, use Gunicorn:

sh
Copy code
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
-w 4: Number of worker processes (adjust based on server capacity).
-b 0.0.0.0:8000: Bind to all IP addresses on port 8000.
app:app: Refers to the Flask application instance (app) in app.py.
4. Access the Application
Local Access: Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
Remote Access: Ensure that port 8000 is open and accessible from the network.
5. Logging
The application logs are stored in app_logs.log. Log messages include:

INFO: General information (e.g., page rendering, data received).
ERROR: Errors and exceptions.
6. File Descriptions
app.py: Main application file with Flask routes and logging configuration.
templates/index.html: HTML template for the web interface.
app_logs.log: Log file where application logs are saved.
.env: Environment configuration file (optional).
Troubleshooting
No Server Displayed: Ensure Gunicorn is running properly and that port 8000 is not blocked by a firewall.
Port Already in Use: Change the port number in the Gunicorn command if necessary.
